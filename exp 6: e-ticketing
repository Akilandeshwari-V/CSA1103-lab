1.0 HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS: 

 Intel Pentium Processor I3/I5 

1.1 SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS: 

Rational rose / Argo UML

1.2 PROBLEM ANALYSIS AND PROJECT PLANNING 

In the E-Ticketing system the main process is a applicant have to login the database then the database verifies that particular username and password then the user must fill the details about their personal details then selecting the flight and the database books the ticket then send it to the applicant then searching the flight or else cancelling the process

1.3 PROJECT DESCRIPTION: 

This software is designed for supporting the computerized e-ticketing. This is widely used by the passenger for reserving the tickets for their travel. This E-ticketing is organized by the central system. The information is provided from the railway reservation system. 

1.4 REFERENCES:
 IEEE Software Requirement Specification format.
PROGRAM CODING:
PASSENGER:
Public class passenger
{
	Public integer passenger passenger name;
	Public integer passenger passenger age;
	Public integer train no;
	Public void passenger()
	{
	}
	
Public void new operation()
	{
	}
}	
CENTRAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM:
Public class central management
{
	Public integer train name;
	Public integer passenger name;
	Public void reservation()
	{
	}
	Public void cancellation()
	{
	}
	Public void status()
	{
	}
	Public void login()
	{
	}
Private void management()
	{
	}
}
RAILWAY RESERVATION SYSTEM:
Public class railway reservation system
{
	Public integer trainno;
	Public integer train name;
	Public integer passenger name;
	Public void status()
	{
	}
	Public void reservation()
	{
	}
	Public void cancellation()
	{
	}
	Public void railway reservation system()
	{
	}
}




RESULT:
Thus the diagrams[use case, activity, sequence, collaboration, class, statechart, component, deployment, package] for the E-ticketing system has been designed, executed and output is verified.
